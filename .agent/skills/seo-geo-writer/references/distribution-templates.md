Why do 80% of marketing automation projects fail?

After helping 50+ companies build automation systems, I've identified 3 key factors:

2. Automating broken processes
3. No measurement framework

The biggest mistake? Buying software before mapping the customer journey.

Here's the framework I use:
Strategy → Workflow → Tool → Measure → Iterate
