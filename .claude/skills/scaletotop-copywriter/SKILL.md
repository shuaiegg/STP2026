# Scaletotop Copywriter

Generate brand-compliant Chinese copy for scaletotop.com that aligns with the brand's identity as a growth system builder for Chinese overseas businesses (B2B, cross-border e-commerce, DTC).

## Brand Identity & Positioning

**Core Identity**:
- Individual/small team **growth system builder**
- Core attributes: Replicable methods, long-term stability, systematic approach
- NOT: Agency services, ad tricks blogger, short-term solutions provider

**Brand Voice**:
- Rational, clear, restrained
- Evidence-based, not emotional
- Use practical examples/experience to validate conclusions, not to show off expertise
- Ensure logical clarity so first-time visitors quickly understand value

## Target Audience

- Chinese overseas businesses (B2B foreign trade, cross-border e-commerce DTC, small teams)
- Seeking to build overseas customer acquisition systems, not just run ads
- Interested in systems, processes, and automation but initially resistant to abstract terms

## Expression Principles by Section

### Homepage First Screen
**Say**:
- Results (acquire overseas inquiries/customers)
- Stability, replicability, long-term viability, methods

**Avoid**:
- Abstract terms: "system", "architecture", "automation"
- Skills, tricks, agency services

### Homepage Second Screen & Below
**Allowed**:
- Gradual introduction of "system", "methodology", "process", "structure"
- Maintain rational, restrained tone with practical validation

### Blog/Course Pages
**Allowed**:
- "System", "methodology", "process", "combination", "validation"
- Focus on reader benefits, not personal heroics

### Tool/Product Pages
**Allowed**:
- "Automation", "tools", "API", "templates", "productization"
- Emphasize practical value and ease of use

## Copy Constraints by Page Type

| Page/Module | Allowed Vocabulary | Prohibited Vocabulary |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Homepage First Screen | 海外客户, 稳定获客, 长期可用, 方法 | 系统, 架构, 自动化, 技巧, 代运营 |
| Homepage Second Screen | 方法, 流程, 组合, 工具, 可持续 | 零散技巧, 一次性方案 |
| Blog/Course Pages | 系统, 方法论, 流程, 组合, 验证 | 炫耀经验, 个人故事为主 |
| Tool/Product Pages | 自动化, 工具, API, 模板, 产品化 | 复杂术语, 不落地流程 |
| About Page | 方法论来源, 实践经验, 系统思维 | 履历式自我炫耀, 广告技巧突出 |

## CTA (Call-to-Action) Principles

**Homepage**:
- Primary CTA: 查看获客方法与实战拆解 (View customer acquisition methods and case studies)
- Secondary CTA: 正在构建的工具/课程 (Tools/courses in development)

**Blog Pages**:
- 阅读文章 → 学习方法 (Read article → Learn methods)

**Tool Pages**:
- 尝试/申请使用工具 → 体验自动化流程 (Try/apply for tool → Experience automated workflow)

## Examples

**Homepage H1**:
"帮中国企业稳定获取海外询盘与客户"

**Homepage Subtitle**:
"通过广告、内容与工具的组合，把一次性的海外获客，变成可长期使用的获客方式"

**About Opening**:
"我专注于帮助外贸与跨境团队，把海外获客过程变得更稳定、更可复制"

## Copywriting Workflow

When generating copy, follow this workflow:

1. **Identify page type** - Determine which page type the copy is for (homepage first screen, blog, tool page, etc.)

2. **Check vocabulary constraints** - Review the Copy Constraints table for allowed and prohibited vocabulary

3. **Apply expression principles** - Ensure the tone is rational, clear, and restrained. Focus on results and practical value.

4. **Validate against brand identity** - Confirm the copy positions the brand as a growth system builder, not an agency or tricks provider

5. **Review CTA alignment** - If the copy includes CTAs, ensure they follow the CTA principles for the page type

6. **Final check** - Verify no prohibited terms are used and the copy is immediately understandable to first-time visitors

## Output Format

Provide the final copy directly without multiple versions or step-by-step confirmation. Include:
- The complete copy ready to use
- Brief explanation of how the copy follows brand guidelines (if clarification would be helpful)
